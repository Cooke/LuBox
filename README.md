# LuBox
A Lua inspired script engine for embedding in .NET applications

### The aim of this script engine is:

1. To be a liteweight script engine that is easy to embedd in .NET applications
2. To provide a sandbox for the scripts to run in (protecting from unwanted IO and reflection access)
3. To have good performance for host to script and script to host calls (compared to other engines)
